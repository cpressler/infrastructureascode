Two options - the first, as you said in your own answer, is setting the environment variable ANSIBLE_HOST_KEY_CHECKING to False.

The second way to set it is to put it in an ansible.cfg file, and that's a really useful option because you can either set that globally (at system or user level, in /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg or ~/.ansible.cfg), or in an config file in the same directory as the playbook you are running.

To do that, make an ansible.cfg file in one of those locations, and include this:

[defaults]
host_key_checking = False

OR
export ANSIBLE_HOST_KEY_CHECKING=False


ansible -i inventory do_single  -m ping
